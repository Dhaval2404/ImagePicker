Easy to use and configurable library to **Pick an image from the Gallery or Capture image using Camera**. It also allows to **Crop and Compresses the Image based on Aspect Ratio, Resolution and Image Size**.

Almost 90% of the app that I have developed has an Image upload feature. Along with the image selection, Sometimes  I needed a crop feature for profile image for that I've used uCrop. Most of the time I need to compress the image as the image captured from the camera is more than 5-10 MBs and sometimes we have a requirement to upload images with specific resolution/size, in that case, image compress is the way to go option. To simplify the image pick/capture option I have created ImagePicker library. I hope it will be useful to all.

# üê±‚ÄçüèçFeatures:
	
* Pick Gallery Image
* Pick Image from Google Drive
* Capture Camera Image
* Crop Image (Crop image based on provided aspect ratio or let user choose one)
* Compress Image (Compress image based on provided resolution and size)
* Retrieve Image Result as Uri object (Retrieve as File object feature is removed in v2.0 to support scope storage)
* Handle runtime permission for camera
* Does not require storage permission to pick gallery image or capture new image.

# üíªUsage


1. Gradle dependency:

	```groovy
	allprojects {
	   repositories {
           	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	   }
	}
	```

    ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.dhaval2404:imagepicker:2.1'
    ```

   **If you are yet to Migrate on AndroidX, Use support build artifact:**
   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.dhaval2404:imagepicker-support:1.7.1'
    ```


2. The ImagePicker configuration is created using the builder pattern.

	**Kotlin**

	```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .crop()	    			//Crop image(Optional), Check Customization for more option
            .compress(1024)			//Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)	//Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start()
    ```

    **Java**

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .crop()	    			//Crop image(Optional), Check Customization for more option
            .compress(1024)			//Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)	//Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start()
    ```

3. Handling results

    **Override `onActivityResult` method and handle ImagePicker result.**

    ```kotlin
    override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
         super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
         if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
             //Image Uri will not be null for RESULT_OK
             val uri: Uri = data?.data!!

             // Use Uri object instead of File to avoid storage permissions
             imgProfile.setImageURI(fileUri)
         } else if (resultCode == ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR) {
             Toast.makeText(this, ImagePicker.getError(data), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         } else {
             Toast.makeText(this, "Task Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         }
    }
    ```

    **Inline method (with registerForActivityResult, Only Works with FragmentActivity and AppCompatActivity)**

    i. Add required dependency for registerForActivityResult API

    ```groovy
	implementation "androidx.activity:activity-ktx:1.2.3"
    implementation "androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:1.3.3"
    ```

    ii. Declare this method inside fragment or activity class

    ```kotlin
    private val startForProfileImageResult =
        registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()) { result: ActivityResult ->
            val resultCode = result.resultCode
            val data = result.data

            if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                //Image Uri will not be null for RESULT_OK
                val fileUri = data?.data!!

                mProfileUri = fileUri
                imgProfile.setImageURI(fileUri)
            } else if (resultCode == ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR) {
                Toast.makeText(this, ImagePicker.getError(data), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            } else {
                Toast.makeText(this, "Task Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            }
        }
    ```

    iii. Create ImagePicker instance and launch intent

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .compress(1024)         //Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)  //Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .createIntent { intent ->
                startForProfileImageResult.launch(intent)
            }
    ```


# üé®Customization

 *  Pick image using Gallery

	```kotlin
	ImagePicker.with(this)
		.galleryOnly()	//User can only select image from Gallery
		.start()	//Default Request Code is ImagePicker.REQUEST_CODE
    ```

 *  Capture image using Camera

	```kotlin
	ImagePicker.with(this)
		.cameraOnly()	//User can only capture image using Camera
		.start()
    ```
 *  Crop image

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.crop()	    //Crop image and let user choose aspect ratio.
		.start()
	```
 *  Crop image with fixed Aspect Ratio

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.crop(16f, 9f)	//Crop image with 16:9 aspect ratio
		.start()
    ```
 *  Crop square image(e.g for profile)

     ```kotlin
     ImagePicker.with(this)
         .cropSquare()	//Crop square image, its same as crop(1f, 1f)
         .start()
    ```
 *  Compress image size(e.g image should be maximum 1 MB)

	```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)

    ```
 *  Intercept ImageProvider, Can be used for analytics

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
        .setImageProviderInterceptor { imageProvider -> //Intercept ImageProvider
            Log.d("ImagePicker", "Selected ImageProvider: "+imageProvider.name)
        }
        .start()
    ```
 *  Intercept Dialog dismiss event

	```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
    	.setDismissListener {
    		// Handle dismiss event
    		Log.d("ImagePicker", "onDismiss");
    	}
    	.start()
    ```

 *  Specify Directory to store captured, cropped or compressed images. *Do not use external public storage directory (i.e. Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory())*

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
       /// Provide directory path to save images, Added example saveDir method. You can choose directory as per your need.

       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/files
       .saveDir(getExternalFilesDir(null)!!)
       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/files/DCIM
       .saveDir(getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM)!!)
       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/files/Download
       .saveDir(getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)!!)
       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/files/Pictures
       .saveDir(getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)!!)
       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/files/Pictures/ImagePicker
       .saveDir(File(getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)!!, "ImagePicker"))
       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/files/ImagePicker
       .saveDir(getExternalFilesDir("ImagePicker")!!)
       //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/package/cache/ImagePicker
       .saveDir(File(getExternalCacheDir(), "ImagePicker"))
       //  Path: /data/data/package/cache/ImagePicker
       .saveDir(File(getCacheDir(), "ImagePicker"))
       //  Path: /data/data/package/files/ImagePicker
       .saveDir(File(getFilesDir(), "ImagePicker"))

      // Below saveDir path will not work, So do not use it
      //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/DCIM
      //  .saveDir(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM))
      //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/Pictures
      //  .saveDir(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES))
      //  Path: /storage/sdcard0/ImagePicker
      //  .saveDir(File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "ImagePicker"))

        .start()
    ```

 *  Limit MIME types while choosing a gallery image

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
        .galleryMimeTypes(  //Exclude gif images
            mimeTypes = arrayOf(
              "image/png",
              "image/jpg",
              "image/jpeg"
            )
          )
        .start()
    ```

 *  You can also specify the request code with ImagePicker

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.maxResultSize(620, 620)
		.start(101)	//Here 101 is request code, you may use this in onActivityResult
    ```

 *  Add Following parameters in your **colors.xml** file, If you want to customize uCrop Activity.

    ```xml
    <resources>
        <!-- Here you can add color of your choice  -->
        <color name="ucrop_color_toolbar">@color/teal_500</color>
        <color name="ucrop_color_statusbar">@color/teal_700</color>
        <color name="ucrop_color_widget_active">@color/teal_500</color>
