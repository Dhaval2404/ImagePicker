Easy to use and configurable library to **Pick an image from the Gallery or Capture image using Camera**. It also allows to **Crop and Compresses the Image based on Aspect Ratio, Resolution and Image Size**.

Almost 90% of the app that I have developed has an Image upload feature. Along with the image selection, Sometimes  I needed a crop feature for profile image for that I've used uCrop. Most of the time I need to compress the image as the image captured from the camera is more than 5-10 MBs and sometimes we have a requirement to upload images with specific resolution/size, in that case, image compress is the way to go option. To simplify the image pick/capture option I have created ImagePicker library. I hope it will be useful to all.

# üê±‚ÄçüèçFeatures:
	
* Pick Gallery Image
* Pick Image from Google Drive
* Capture Camera Image
* Crop Image(Crop image based on provided aspect ratio or let user choose one)
* Compress Image(Compress image based on provided resolution and size)
* Retrieve Image Result as File, File Path as String or Uri object
* Handle Runtime Permission for Camera and Storage

# üíªUsage


1. Gradle dependency:

	```groovy
	allprojects {
	   repositories {
	      	jcenter()
           	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }  //Make sure to add this in your project for uCrop
	   }
	}
	```

    ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.dhaval2404:imagepicker:1.8'
    ```
    
   **If you are yet to Migrate on AndroidX, Use support build artifact:**
   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.dhaval2404:imagepicker-support:1.7.1'
    ```

    **If you want to get the activity result inline in a modern way (lambda) install [InlineActivityResult](https://github.com/florent37/InlineActivityResult) library:**
   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.florent37:inline-activity-result-kotlin:1.0.4'
    ```
    
2.  <span style="color:red">**If you target Android 10 or higher(targetSdkVersion >= 29)**</span>, set the value of ``requestLegacyExternalStorage`` to true in your app's manifest file:

      ```xml
    <manifest ... >
          <!-- This attribute is "false" by default on apps targeting
               Android 10 or higher. -->
          <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ... >
            ...
          </application>
    </manifest>
      ```

3. The ImagePicker configuration is created using the builder pattern.

	**Kotlin**
    
	```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .allowMultiple(true)    //to allow multiple select image, will disable crop and compress function
            .crop()	    			//Crop image(Optional), Check Customization for more option
            .compress(1024)			//Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)	//Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start()
    ```
    
    **Java**
    
    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.Companion.with(this)
            .crop()	    			//Crop image(Optional), Check Customization for more option
            .compress(1024)			//Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)	//Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start()
    ```
    
4. Handling results

    
    **Default method(Preferred way)**<br>
    Override `onActivityResult` method and handle ImagePicker result.

    ```kotlin
    override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
         super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
         if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
             //Image Uri will not be null for RESULT_OK
             val fileUri = data?.data
             imgProfile.setImageURI(fileUri)
          
            //You can get File object from intent
            val file:File = ImagePicker.getFile(data)!!
           
            //You can also get File Path from intent
            val filePath:String = ImagePicker.getFilePath(data)!!
            
            //get File objects from intent for multiple select mode
            val files: List<File> = ImagePicker.getFiles(data)
            
            //get File Paths from intent for multiple select mode
            val filePaths: List<String> = ImagePicker.getFilePaths(data)
            
         } else if (resultCode == ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR) {
             Toast.makeText(this, ImagePicker.getError(data), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         } else {
             Toast.makeText(this, "Task Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         }
    }
    ```

    **Inline method (with InlineActivityResult library, Only Works with FragmentActivity and AppCompatActivity) (Not to be used with crop. See [#32](https://github.com/Dhaval2404/ImagePicker/issues/32))**
    
    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .compress(1024)         //Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)  //Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start { resultCode, data ->
                if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                    //Image Uri will not be null for RESULT_OK
                     val fileUri = data?.data
                     imgProfile.setImageURI(fileUri)
                  
                    //You can get File object from intent
                    val file:File = ImagePicker.getFile(data)
                   
                    //You can also get File Path from intent
                    val filePath:String = ImagePicker.getFilePath(data)
                } else if (resultCode == ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR) {
                    Toast.makeText(context, ImagePicker.getError(data), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                } else {
                    Toast.makeText(context, "Task Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                }
            }
    ```
